# Scene Server

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/bnolan/scene-server.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/bnolan/scene-server)

The scene server is a component of my opensource metaverse project. It loads scene files in .xml format and listens for clients on a websocket connection. Any connected client gets a streamed version of the world sent to them. You can write scripts in javascript using <script /> tags in your scenefile to provide interactivity to connected clients.
